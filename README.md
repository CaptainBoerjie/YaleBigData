# YaleBigData

This is a Big Data project to explore two fields, data science, and Arabic media.

# Current Effort

Currently, working through the main sources list (SourceList.txt) to determine best scraping method.  All sources offer RSS feeds, but some require Newspaper3k (very simple), some require BeautifulSoup (source specific code), and some require Selenium and BeautifulSoup because the RSS format is broken.

Addition efforts:
- Learning how to use relative imports as the package file tree grows and code is shared throughout.
- Continuing to clean the existing database of NULL fields, broken links, and missing published dates.


# Built With
